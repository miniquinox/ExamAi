            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <p>Our platform consists of three integrated portals designed to transform how exams are created, taken, and graded:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professor App:</strong> Create and set up exams with custom grading rubrics.</li>
                <li><strong>Student App:</strong> A secure environment for students to take exams.</li>
                <li><strong>Grading Portal:</strong> Access and analyze exam results efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="workflow">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create an Exam:</strong> Use the Professor App to write exams with specific grading rubrics, set a grading password, and receive a unique exam ID.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exam Taking:</strong> Students use the unique exam ID to access and take the exam through the Student App, which ensures integrity through proctoring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grading:</strong> Post-exam, enter your exam ID and grading password in the Professor Grading Portal to initiate AI grading.
                    <p>Click "AI Grade" to start the automated grading process, which completes in about 5 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Review Results:</strong> View detailed grades per student and question. Students receive their grades via email and can also view class-wide statistics in the Main Grading Portal.
